High-level rust bindings zo the zbar library

Just started implementing a high-level rust binding to zbar barcode scanner library.
Some things already work, but there is still a lot to do. So don't expect this to work without flaws.
And expect things to break!

You need zbar native library in order to build zbars.

Examples and documentation will follow in the next weeks.
