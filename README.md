# zbar-rs
High-level rust bindings zo the zbar library

Just started implementing a high-level rust binding to zbar barcode scanner library.
Some things already work, but there is still a lot to do. So don't expect this to work without flaws.
And expect things to break!

You need zbar native library in order to build zbar-rs.

Examples and documentation will follow in the next weeks.
